# CS F425 Deep Learning Assignment - Group 4
### Replication of "Mind the Pool: Convolutional Neural Networks can Overfit Input Size" paper
Repository containing the codebase of our semester-long Deep Learning assignment. Submitted as partial fulfilment of CS F425 Deep Learning Semester II AY 2024-25 at BITS Pilani K. K. Birla Goa Campus 

### Group Members:
1. Priyanshu Volvotkar (2022A1PS1451G)
2. Akshaj Jain (2022A3PS0057G)
3. Saurav Sahoo (2022A7PS0217G)
4. Shrijat Majumdar (2022A7PS0361G)
5. Naman Kamra (2022A7PS1142G)
6. Atharva Singh Rathore (2022A7PS1203G)

Note: 
Two members worked on the code submitted here, files listed as `dl-assignment-final.ipynb` consists of the code training and evaluating the models at 32x32 on CIFAR-10 dataset (done by Priyanshu) in Keras. The `dl-grp-project` is pytorch implementation of the same on ImageWoof (by Akshaj Jain). Since `dl-assignment-final.ipynb` was used to run several experiments in Kaggle codespace, you may find the latest here: (core functionality not changed, just changes to dataset and training and evaluation image sizes, if any) [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/liquidnitrogen/dl-assignment)

All code files were last changed BEFORE the presentation, the commits have been made before 8:32 PM IST on 15th April 2025.
